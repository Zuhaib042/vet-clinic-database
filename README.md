# Vet-Clinic Database

> This is a beginner PostgreSql project where I created a database and then filled it table data. You can create Table with schema and then insert data into the table with the methods mentioned and then get the specific data with multiple queries.

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
